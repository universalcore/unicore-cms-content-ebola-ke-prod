This way,\r\nthose who are sick are prevented from travelling to Kenya. In addition, when these passengers arrive in our airports (such as JKIA, Moi, Eldoret etc) they are further screened by trained\r\nhealth personnel who have been deployed at our airports to look for possible Ebola patients who may be entering the country. Further, screening is being carried out at all border\r\npoints.",
