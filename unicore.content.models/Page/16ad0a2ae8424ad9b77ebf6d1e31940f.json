Comes in contact with body fluids (blood, saliva, vomitus, stool, urine, sweat and other body fluids)\r\nfrom a person who is infected with Ebola.\r\n 2. Handles dead bodies of persons who have died from Ebola.\r\n 3. Handles personal effects of persons infected or who have died from Ebola e.g. Clothing, beddings. \r\n 4. Comes in contact with contaminated environment (surfaces).\r\n 5. Can also be spread by handling or eating raw meat of Ebola infected chimpanzees, gorillas,\r\nmonkeys, porcupines, forest antelopes and Fruit Bats. \r\n\r\n**Note:** Ebola cannot be transmitted through the air.",
