Recently Nigeria reported cases as a result of human movement and interaction within the affected countries. Kenya is among countries at risk because of its geographical location, frequent human movements and interactions which occurs through many flights to and from West Africa which may facilitate movement of people who may include those with ebola disease. Movement of people also takes place through use of road or sea, this also can facilitate Ebola transmission into the country.",
